# Phase 3 for DSAI 305 Project

This repository contains phase 3 of the DSAI 305 project, encompassing data preprocessing, feature selection, and selected paper based models.


### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Make sure that the venv as active.


## Workflow Instructions

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Start by running the preprocessing step to generate the dataset required for all models:

- [pre_processing_data_Mariam&Habiba.ipynb](pre_processing_data_%20(1).ipynb)

### 2. Feature Selection (Optional)

If you wish to perform feature selection, you can run:

- [Feature_selection_rahma&jehad.ipynb](Feature_selection_rahma&jehadipynb%20(1).ipynb)

### 3. Model Execution

Each model has its own notebook. These are already rendered with outputs and do not need to be rerun unless you wish to experiment further. You can open any of the following:

- [Rahma Ibrahim BPNN.ipynb](BPNN_FOR_rahma_resubmit_.ipynb)
- [Rahma Ibrahim DEEPNET_2.ipynb](DEEPNET_2_RAHMA.ipynb)
- [Rahma Ibrahim XGBoost with ADASYN.ipynb](XGBoost_with_ADASYN_rahma_(1).ipynb)

- [Habiba_Arafa_Extreme_Tree_Classifier.ipynb](Habiba_Arafa_Extreme_Tree_Classifier.ipynb)
- [Habiba_Arafa_KNN.ipynb](HabibaArafa_knn_pynb.ipynb)
- [Habiba_Arafa_SVM_RF.ipynb](Habiba_Arafa_SVM_RF.ipynb)

- [Mariam Hassan_final.ipynb](MariamHassan_final.ipynb)

- [Jehad Mahmoud RandomForest.ipynb](RandomForest_JehadMahmoud.ipynb)
- [Jehad Mahmoud VotingClassifier.ipynb](VotingClassifier_JehadMahmoud%20(2).ipynb)
- [Jehad Mahmoud XGBoost.ipynb](XGBoostJehadMahmoud.ipynb)

## Notes

- Ensure the data from preprocessing is available before running any model.
- Feature selection is optional but can enhance performance.
- All notebooks are pre-executed and include outputs.
